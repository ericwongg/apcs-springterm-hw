Worked with Michelle Chen	

1. The difference between the maps and sets is that maps elements that point to each other order to navigate through the information while sets are simply collections of elements.

2. A HashMap is implemented internally as an array of linked lists. A TreeMap is implemented internally as a black-red tree.

3. TreeMap had a faster insertion time for 1000000 elements.

4. Java does have a built in binary heap implementation under PriorityQueue.
